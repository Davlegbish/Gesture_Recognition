# Action_Recognition
Action Recognition is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and classifying human actions or movements in video data. Leveraging machine learning and deep learning algorithms, action recognition systems can analyze sequences of frames to detect actions like walking, running, jumping, or more complex activities such as dancing or playing sports. These systems rely on spatial and temporal features within the video, often using models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or architectures like 3D CNNs and transformers, which can capture both the appearance and movement patterns over time. Action recognition has applications in various fields, including surveillance, healthcare, human-computer interaction, sports analytics, and autonomous systems, where understanding human activity is critical for informed decision-making and responsive automation.
